- Made a small code to do metropolis monte carlo optimization in ASE using ANI2x, but it can be changed to use any calculator
- Takes in any .xyz in the directory, must be named molecule.xyz though
- Runs monte carlo optimization, for 1 million steps starting at 10,000 kelvin
- implemented simulated annealing with a linear decaying temperature
- steps and starting temp can be changed of course
- also has a dynamic step size, if acceptance rate is <30%, decrease step size by 10%, and if its above 50% increase it by 10%
- Fun little project to test how to do monte carlo
